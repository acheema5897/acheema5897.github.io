            <p class="text">From its origins to its modern applications, the term "algorithm" has had an interesting evolution throughout history. Taking a journey through time to understand how this keyword has evolved is essential to grasp its contemporary significance.</p>

            <br>
            <p class="text">The term "algorithm" traces its roots to the name of the Arabic mathematician and scholar Al-Khwarizmi, who lived during the Islamic Golden Age in the 9th century. Al-Khwarizmi's work laid a west-to-east bridging foundation for algebra and introduced step-by-step principles for solving mathematical problems, known as “The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing”. </p>
            <br>
            <p class="text">Another book Al-Khwarizmi worked on was the “Book of Addition and Subtraction According to Hindu Calculation” which was translated into Latin by the Latin scholar Adelard of Bath with the opening phrase being “dixit algorizme.” The Latin phrase “dixit algorism” translates to “thus said Al-Khwarizmi” in which the Latinized form of “Al-Khwarizmi” name can be inferred to the term “Algorithm.”</p>
            <br>
            <p class="text">Al-Khwarizmi played a historical role in signifying the use of systematic methods for calculating mathematical problems, which is why through Latin translations Al-Khwarizmi’s name was used to coin the term “algorithm (Gearon, 2019).”  </p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="text">Contemporary Definition</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="text">In the current modern age, the meaning of "algorithm" has expanded far beyond its mathematical origins. The contemporary meaning of “algorithm” in irony takes a more general application of the term being a set of steps to problem-solve a task.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="text">This general meaning of” “algorithm” is not limited to math as it enables the use of “algorithms” in any application. Throughout history this way of thinking allowed people to incorporate “algorithms” in various fields like medicine, sports and more.</p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="text">Defining "Algorithm" for my Final Project</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="text">I will be using the digital and computational meaning of “algorithm” to showcase the comparisons of reinforcement learning algorithms to behavioural reinforcement practices in humans. </p>
            <br>
            <p class="text">In the digital age, algorithms are sets of instructions executed by computers to perform a wide range of tasks. They power search engines, recommend content, manage social media feeds, and even drive autonomous vehicles. Algorithms have become indispensable in our daily lives, influencing what we see on the internet, how we shop online, and even how medical diagnoses are made.</p>
