            <h3 class="text">Introduction </h3>
            <br>
            <p class="text">My final project covers the research question of how humans differ from artificial intelligence (AI) in reinforcement learning. I will explain how deep reinforcement learning models used in AI are designed after human behaviour psychology and neuroscience.</p>
            <br>

            <h3 class="text">Artificial Intelligence (AI) </h3>
            <br>
            <p class="text">Artificial intelligence (AI) to put simply is the idea of simulating human intelligence with technology. Programmers simulate human behaviour in particular learning through a concept under AI called Machine Learning.</p>
            <br>

            <h3 class="text">Machine learning</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="text">Machine Learning is a broad concept that attempts to simulate human behaviour through various algorithms. For example, there exist genetic algorithms designed after biological evolution to solve tasks. However, the particular machine learning algorithm I will be discussing in this project is reinforcement learning which is modelled after the human reward mechanism (Littman, 2023).</p>
            <br>

            <h3 class="text">Reinforcement Learning (RL) </h3>

            <br>
            <p class="text">Reinforcement Learning is a type of Machine Learning algorithm that simulates human intelligence through decision-making influenced by a reward mechanism as designed after behavioural operant conditioning and neuroscience.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="text">To put it simply, there is an agent (robot, human) that interacts with an environment (digital, real) using policies that help form future decisions based on previous actions and their consequences.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="text">A fairly common decision-making model used in reinforcement learning AI is Markov’s Decision Processing (MDP) model (Subramanian et al, 2022).</p>

            <h3 class="text">Classical and Operant Conditioning</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="text">Both Classical and Operant Conditioning have their origins in behaviour and neuroscience in biological creatures as associative involuntary and voluntary responses to stimuli and consequences respectively.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="text">Classical Conditioning is the concept behind associating an involuntary action like drooling to a stimulus like food as demonstrated in the case of the famous Pavlov's dog experiment.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="text">Operant Conditioning is the concept behind associating a voluntary action with consequences and rewards which is backed by neuroscience through the chemical dopamine produced in biological reward mechanisms (Cherry, 2023).</p>
            <br>
            <p class="text">Reinforcement Learning makes use of a neuroscience understanding of Operant Conditioning to compute a decision (policy) in response to consequences (rewards). How exactly does Reinforcement Learning Modeled AI make decisions is through a process called Markov Decision Process (MDP).</p>
            <br>

            <h3 class="text">The Turing Test by Alan Turing</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="text">The Turing Test produced by British Scientist Alan Turing is a historically famous benchmark to test Artificial Intelligence as the concept behind AI is to simulate human behaviour. </p>
            <br>
            <p class="text">Alan Turing’s Turing Test focuses on a particular aspect of human intelligence which was human conversations by testing if AI could deceive an actual human into thinking it is talking to another human (Turing, 1950).</p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="text">Reflection</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="text">Reflecting on my final project, if I could do it over again I would have managed my time better as my goal was too ambitious to complete in time. I had spent weeks learning Django and simulating Reinforcement Learning AI using Open AI’s gymnasium framework for Python only to fall short as there was not enough time to construct a finished product for the project. I ended up resorting to creating a written report for my research question without interactive elements as I had hoped to add.</p>
