            <p class="text">My infographic based off Dr. Buolamwini's "Gender Shades" experiment, aims to communicate the nuances of algorithmic bias effectively. It differs from some of the infographics we studied in class by employing a higher proportion of visuals and statistics, enhancing its visual appeal despite the abundance of text.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="text">The infographic successfully guides readers through the core aspects of the facial recognition experiment, emphasizing the consequences of data bias on gender classification accuracy. However, upon reflection, it became evident that a more thorough explanation of the experiment's error margins would have made it better.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="text">Visually, my infographic is designed to be self-explanatory, allowing readers to grasp the primary message through images alone. While it is visually compelling, there's room for improvement in terms of clarity.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="text">Through this assignment, I've realized that the most effective infographics strike a balance between visuals and text, where visuals can independently convey the narrative or argument and text complements it. This approach fosters reader engagement and enhances the spread of information.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="text">In addition, I used to view infographics as being easy to produce as they are mostly composed of visuals unlike other methods which are more text-heavy, but there is a great deal of thought and design that goes into infographics.
